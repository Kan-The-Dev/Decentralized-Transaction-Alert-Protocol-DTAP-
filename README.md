#Decentralized-Transaction-Alert-Protocol-DTAP

#Problem

-In traditional blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), users often face significant delays in transaction confirmation due to network congestion and block mining times. During this waiting period:

-Receivers have no information about pending transactions unless the transaction is fully confirmed and added to a block.

-Senders and receivers lack a way to verify or monitor in-process transactions in real-time.

-This lack of real-time transparency makes the process tedious, time-consuming, and frustrating.

#Solution

*To solve this problem, we can create a specialized blockchain that focuses solely on notifying users of upcoming or pending transactions. This blockchain would:

-Provide real-time updates to both senders and receivers about pending transactions.

-Ensure transparency and integrity by implementing cryptographic methods (e.g., digital signatures) to prevent fake transaction notifications.
